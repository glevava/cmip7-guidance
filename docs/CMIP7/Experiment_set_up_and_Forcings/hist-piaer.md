# Experiment Setup and Forcings Guidance: hist-piAer

Used to diagnose climate responses to the regionally heterogeneous evolution of anthropogenic aerosol emissions.
Anthropogenic aerosols and aerosol precursor emissions (BC, OC, NH3, SO2) evolve as in `piControl`.
All other forcings evolve as in `historical`.
Intended for models without interactive chemistry.
Models with interactive chemistry should run `hist-piAQ` instead.
(Identical to `hist-piAer` in AerChemMIP phase 1.)

- Responsible activity: [AerChemMIP](./index.md#aerchemmip)
- Tier: 1
- MIP co-chair review: **In progress** see
  [https://github.com/WCRP-CMIP/cmip7-guidance/issues/184](https://github.com/WCRP-CMIP/cmip7-guidance/issues/184)

This page is intended to help with implementation.
If you notice something that is unclear, please
[raise an issue](https://github.com/WCRP-CMIP/cmip7-guidance/issues/new).

For the full background of the experiment, please see the following URLs:

- [https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-10-585-2017](https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-10-585-2017)

## Paired experiments

- [hist-piAQ](./hist-piaq.md) is the corresponding interactive-chemistry experiment for models that include interactive
  chemistry.

## Experiment set up

### Parent experiment and branching

The hist-piAer experiment branches from the [piControl](./picontrol.md) experiment (part of [CMIP](./index.md#cmip)).
The parent experiment's MIP era is [CMIP7](https://wcrp-cmip.org/CMIP7).

Branch from [piControl](./picontrol.md) at the same time as [historical](./historical.md).

### Output time axis

Your output time axis must start on 1850-01-01 and must end on 2021-12-31.
You must perform the full simulation i.e. 172 simulation years.

### Minimum ensemble size

Only one ensemble member is required.

## Forcings

The following information will help you identify the forcings to use.
However, we can't define every single detail because there can be lots of subjective steps between the raw forcings data
and model inputs (e.g. interpolation, re-aggregation, supplementation with other information).
If further guidance would be helpful, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/WCRP-CMIP/cmip7-guidance/issues/new).

### General headlines

The hist-piAer experiment is a transient forcings experiment.

### Data

Here we make a distinction between data that is described on other experiment pages, data that is described on other
experiment pages with modifications you have to make yourself, data available via ESGF's input4MIPs project and data
distributed via other channels.

#### Data described on other experiment pages

For the following data, please see these other experiment pages:

- [historical](./historical.md) for land use, greenhouse gas concentrations, stratospheric aerosol forcing, ozone,
  nitrogen deposition, solar, aerosol optical properties, population density

#### Data described on other experiment pages with modifications you have to make

For the following forcings, please use data from the specified experiments with the specified modifications.

- for anthropogenic emissions, use the forcings from [historical](./historical.md) but BC, OC, NH<sub>3</sub> and
  SO<sub>2</sub> emissions should be fixed to [piControl simulation](./picontrol.md) values
- for biomass burning emissions, use the forcings from [historical](./historical.md) but BC, OC, NH<sub>3</sub> and
  SO<sub>2</sub> emissions should be fixed to [piControl simulation](./picontrol.md) values

#### Data available via input4MIPs

No input4MIPs-based data is described specifically on this page.
Please see the other [data](#data) sub-sections for details of the forcings data to use for this experiment.

#### Data not available via input4MIPs

No data that is not input4MIPs-based is described specifically on this page.
Please see the other [data](#data) sub-sections for details of the forcings data to use for this experiment.
