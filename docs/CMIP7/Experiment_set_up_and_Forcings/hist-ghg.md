# Experiment Setup and Forcings Guidance: hist-GHG

Response to historical greenhouse gas forcing (with extension using forcings from the `m` scenario simulation).
All other conditions are kept the same as piControl.

- Responsible activity: [DAMIP](./index.md#damip)
- Tier: 1
- MIP co-chair review: **In progress** see
  [https://github.com/WCRP-CMIP/cmip7-guidance/issues/188](https://github.com/WCRP-CMIP/cmip7-guidance/issues/188)

This page is intended to help with implementation.
If you notice something that is unclear, please
[raise an issue](https://github.com/WCRP-CMIP/cmip7-guidance/issues/new).

For the full background of the experiment, please see the following URLs:

## Experiment set up

### Parent experiment and branching

The hist-GHG experiment branches from the [piControl](./picontrol.md) experiment (part of [CMIP](./index.md#cmip)).
The parent experiment's MIP era is [CMIP7](https://wcrp-cmip.org/CMIP7).

Branch from [piControl](./picontrol.md) at the same time as [historical](./historical.md).

### Output time axis

Your output time axis must start on 1850-01-01 and must end on 2035-12-31.
You must perform the full simulation i.e. 186 simulation years.

### Minimum ensemble size

At least 3 ensemble members are required.

## Forcings

The following information will help you identify the forcings to use.
However, we can't define every single detail because there can be lots of subjective steps between the raw forcings data
and model inputs (e.g. interpolation, re-aggregation, supplementation with other information).
If further guidance would be helpful, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/WCRP-CMIP/cmip7-guidance/issues/new).

### General headlines

The hist-GHG experiment uses a mix of fixed and transient forcings.
The fixed forcings are: aerosol optical properties, anthropogenic emissions, biomass burning emissions, land use,
nitrogen deposition, ozone, population density, solar and stratospheric aerosol forcing.
The transient forcings are: greenhouse gas concentrations.

### Data

Here we make a distinction between data that is described on other experiment pages, data that is described on other
experiment pages with modifications you have to make yourself, data available via ESGF's input4MIPs project and data
distributed via other channels.

#### Data described on other experiment pages

For the following data, please see these other experiment pages:

- [historical](./historical.md) for greenhouse gas concentrations
- [scen7-m](./scen7-m.md) for greenhouse gas concentrations
- [piControl](./picontrol.md) for anthropogenic emissions, biomass burning emissions, land use, stratospheric aerosol
  forcing, solar, aerosol optical properties, population density, ozone, nitrogen deposition

#### Data described on other experiment pages with modifications you have to make

No data described on other experiment pages requires modifications by you.
Please see the other [data](#data) sub-sections for details of the forcings data to use for this experiment.

#### Data available via input4MIPs

No input4MIPs-based data is described specifically on this page.
Please see the other [data](#data) sub-sections for details of the forcings data to use for this experiment.

#### Data not available via input4MIPs

No data that is not input4MIPs-based is described specifically on this page.
Please see the other [data](#data) sub-sections for details of the forcings data to use for this experiment.
