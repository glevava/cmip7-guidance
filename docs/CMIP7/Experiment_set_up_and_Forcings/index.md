# CMIP7 Experiment Setup and Forcings Guidance

!!! tip "Documentation under review"

    The contents of these pages are currently under review.
    On each experiment page, you will see a dot point for "MIP co-chair review".
    Where this says "Complete", you can assume that the guidance is stable and reliable.
    Otherwise, please treat the guidance with some caution, because it has not been reviewed by the experiment designers
    (the MIP co-chairs) yet.
    If you have any feedback, please feel free to raise an issue at
    https://github.com/WCRP-CMIP/cmip7-guidance/issues/new and tag @znichollscr.

These pages provide guidance on the experimental setup and forcings to be used in CMIP7.
They are updated regularly, hence should be considered the current source of guidance.
The papers which describe the experiments in the scientific literature are the original source and key reference, but
they may still contain errors which cannot be fixed after publication so should not be relied upon in isolation.
The papers also provide further information about each simulation than what is provided here, such as the motivation,
history and results from previous CMIP phases.

These pages specify the intended way to run each simulation.
However, we understand that modelling groups sometimes need to make changes for a variety of reasons.
We are currently discussing a mechanism for modeling centers to document these alterations in a central, publicly
accessible location (for example,
[discussion of how to choose values for the forcing 'f' identifier is ongoing](https://github.com/PCMDI/input4MIPs_CVs/issues/415)).
When these discussions are finalised, these guidance pages will be updated.

### ScenarioMIP

Future scenario experiments.
Exploration of the future climate under a (selected) range of possible boundary conditions.

The priority of ScenarioMIP experiments (expressed as Tier 1 and 2) is summarized in the flowchart below, which is based
on Table 1 of [Van Vuuren et al. 2026](https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/19/2627/2026/).
Emissions-driven experiments, indicated in yellow, have names beginning with `esm-`.

- If your model is capable of running in emissions-driven mode, ScenarioMIP request emissions-driven scenarios, and
  additionally the concentration-driven experiment `scen7-m`, at Tier-1 (highest priority).
- If your model will run only the concentration-driven experiments, ScenarioMIP request all concentration-driven
  scenarios at Tier-1.

If you are running in emissions-driven mode, you are welcome to run other scenarios in concentration-driven mode, but
they have not been assigned a specific tier (i.e., are lowest priority).
