# Experiment Setup and Forcings Guidance: scen7-h-Aer

Used to diagnose climate responses to the regionally heterogeneous evolution of anthropogenic aerosol emissions.
Anthropogenic aerosols and aerosol precursor emissions (BC, OC, NH3, SO2) are held constant at present-day (2021)
levels.
All other forcings evolve as in `scen7-h`.
Intended for models without interactive chemistry.
Models with interactive chemistry should run `scen7-h-AQ` instead.

- Responsible activity: [AerChemMIP](./index.md#aerchemmip)
- Tier: 1
- MIP co-chair review: **In progress** see
  [https://github.com/WCRP-CMIP/cmip7-guidance/issues/184](https://github.com/WCRP-CMIP/cmip7-guidance/issues/184)

This page is intended to help with implementation.
If you notice something that is unclear, please
[raise an issue](https://github.com/WCRP-CMIP/cmip7-guidance/issues/new).

For the full background of the experiment, please see the following URLs:

- [https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-10-585-2017](https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-10-585-2017)

## Paired experiments

- [esm-scen7-h-Aer](./esm-scen7-h-aer.md) is the emissions-driven counterpart to this concentration-driven experiment.
- [scen7-h-AQ](./scen7-h-aq.md) is the corresponding interactive-chemistry experiment for models that include
  interactive chemistry.

## Experiment set up

### Parent experiment and branching

The scen7-h-Aer experiment branches from the [historical](./historical.md) experiment (part of [CMIP](./index.md#cmip)).
The parent experiment's MIP era is [CMIP7](https://wcrp-cmip.org/CMIP7).

Branch from [historical](./historical.md) at 2021-12-31.

### Output time axis

Your output time axis must start on 2022-01-01 and must end on 2100-12-31.
You must perform the full simulation i.e. 79 simulation years.

### Minimum ensemble size

Only one ensemble member is required.

## Forcings

The following information will help you identify the forcings to use.
However, we can't define every single detail because there can be lots of subjective steps between the raw forcings data
and model inputs (e.g. interpolation, re-aggregation, supplementation with other information).
If further guidance would be helpful, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/WCRP-CMIP/cmip7-guidance/issues/new).

### General headlines

The scen7-h-Aer experiment uses a mix of fixed and transient forcings.
The fixed forcings are: anthropogenic emissions and biomass burning emissions.
The transient forcings are: aerosol optical properties, anthropogenic emissions, biomass burning emissions, greenhouse
gas concentrations, land use, nitrogen deposition, ozone, population density, solar and stratospheric aerosol forcing.

### Data

Here we make a distinction between data that is described on other experiment pages, data that is described on other
experiment pages with modifications you have to make yourself, data available via ESGF's input4MIPs project and data
distributed via other channels.

#### Data described on other experiment pages

For the following data, please see these other experiment pages:

- [scen7-h](./scen7-h.md) for land use, greenhouse gas concentrations, stratospheric aerosol forcing, ozone, nitrogen
  deposition, solar, aerosol optical properties, population density

#### Data described on other experiment pages with modifications you have to make

For the following forcings, please use data from the specified experiments with the specified modifications.

- for anthropogenic emissions, use the forcings from [scen7-h](./scen7-h.md) but only for everything except aerosol (BC,
  OC, NH<sub>3</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>) emissions.
- for biomass burning emissions, use the forcings from [scen7-h](./scen7-h.md) but only for everything except aerosol
  (BC, OC, NH<sub>3</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>) emissions.
- for anthropogenic emissions, use the forcings from [historical](./historical.md) but only for aerosol (BC, OC,
  NH<sub>3</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>) emissions.
  These forcings should be fixed to 2021 values.
- for biomass burning emissions, use the forcings from [historical](./historical.md) but only for aerosol (BC, OC,
  NH<sub>3</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>) emissions.
  These forcings should be fixed to 2021 values.

#### Data available via input4MIPs

No input4MIPs-based data is described specifically on this page.
Please see the other [data](#data) sub-sections for details of the forcings data to use for this experiment.

#### Data not available via input4MIPs

No data that is not input4MIPs-based is described specifically on this page.
Please see the other [data](#data) sub-sections for details of the forcings data to use for this experiment.
